    PreAuthorizedCodeGrant:
      type: object
      description: >
        Object indicating to the Wallet the Grant Types the Credential Issuer's Authorization Server is prepared to process for this Credential Offer. Every grant is represented by a name/value pair. The name is the Grant Type identifier; the value is an object that contains parameters either determining the way the Wallet MUST use the particular grant and/or parameters the Wallet MUST send with the respective request(s). If grants is not present or is empty, the Wallet MUST determine the Grant Types the Credential Issuer's Authorization Server supports using the respective metadata. When multiple grants are present, it is at the Wallet's discretion which one to use.
      properties:
        urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code:

                The code representing the Credential Issuer's authorization for the Wallet to obtain Credentials of a certain type. This code MUST be short lived and single use. If the Wallet decides to use the Pre-Authorized Code Flow, this parameter value MUST be included in the subsequent Token Request with the Pre-Authorized Code Flow.
              example: "oaKazRN8I0IbtZ0C7JuMn5"
            tx_code:
              type: object
              description: >
                Object describing the requirements for a Transaction Code, which the Authorization Server expects the End-User to present along with the Token Request in a Pre-Authorized Code Flow. If the Authorization Server does not expect a Transaction Code, this object is absent; this is the default. The Transaction Code is intended to bind the Pre-Authorized Code to a certain transaction to prevent replay of this code by an attacker that, for example, scanned the QR code while standing behind the legitimate End-User. It is RECOMMENDED to send the Transaction Code via a separate channel. If the Wallet decides to use the Pre-Authorized Code Flow, the Transaction Code value MUST be sent in the tx_code parameter with the respective Token Request as defined in Section 6.1. If no length or description is given, this object may be empty, indicating that a Transaction Code is required

                length:
                  type: integer
                  description: >
                    Integer specifying the length of the Transaction Code. This helps the Wallet to render the input screen and improve the user experience.
                  example: 6
                description:
                  type: string
                  description: >
                    String containing guidance for the Holder of the Wallet on how to obtain the Transaction Code, e.g., describing over which communication channel it is delivered. The Wallet is RECOMMENDED to display this description next to the Transaction Code input screen to improve the user experience. The length of the string MUST NOT exceed 300 characters. The description does not support internationalization, however the Issuer MAY detect the Holder's language by previous communication or an HTTP Accept-Language header within an HTTP GET request for a Credential Offer URI.
